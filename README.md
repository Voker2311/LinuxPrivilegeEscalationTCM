# LinuxPrivilegeEscalationTCM

I have created the notes of the course provided by the Cyber mentor about Linux Privilege Escalation.

The course covers all the methods required to get access as root.
You can master all the techniques of privilege escalation and this will also help you in many CTFs.
This course is really good if you are preparing for OSCP,CEH or Pentest+.

I strongly recommend you to check out this course on udemy.
